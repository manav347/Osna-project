The "Social Media Data Analysis" project leverages advanced computational techniques to extract and scrutinize network data from GitHub, employing web scraping via the BeautifulSoup library and the requests module. The extracted data, encapsulating user connections, is systematically stored in an Excel format, facilitating structured data manipulation. The project uses Gephi's sophisticated graph visualization capabilities to delineate intricate network structures through Fruchterman-Reingold and Yifan Hu layouts. Key network metrics, including degree distribution, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and clustering coefficient, are meticulously analyzed to uncover pivotal insights into network topology, community detection, and influential nodes. The project underscores the robustness of data integrity and error-handling mechanisms, ensuring seamless data extraction and processing. Future directions encompass deeper analytical endeavors and addressing emerging challenges in data privacy and policy, contributing significantly to the field of online social network analysis.
